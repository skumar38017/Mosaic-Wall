✅ CONFIRMED ARCHITECTURE:
1. User scans QR → Mobile browser opens React app
    ✅ No need for native app.
    ✅ Works on any phone with a browser.

2. Mobile React App:
    📷 Uses navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia() to access camera.
    🖼️ Takes photo (as base64 or blob).
    📤 Sends photo to FastAPI backend via HTTP POST (/upload).

3. Backend (FastAPI):
    🛠 Receives uploaded photo.
    🔁 Broadcasts it to all connected WebSocket clients (i.e., kiosks).
    ⚡ Instant propagation = Real-time experience.

4. Kiosk React App:
    🌐 Opens WebSocket connection to FastAPI.
    🖼️ Receives new photo.
    🎨 Displays the photo on the screen in a random position (like a mosaic wall).

🧠 Why This Architecture Is Great
| Feature                           | ✅ Yes |
| --------------------------------- | ----- |
| Real-time                         | ✅     |
| No need for app store             | ✅     |
| Works over LAN/network            | ✅     |
| Fast response                     | ✅     |
| Simple stack                      | ✅     |
| Scalable (add more kiosks easily) | ✅     |

backned architecture 

🏗️ Simple Backend Architecture (FastAPI)
Components:

    HTTP POST Endpoint (/upload)

        Accepts photo uploads from mobile React app.
        Receives photo as multipart/form-data or base64 string.
        Processes and validates image.
        Sends the image data to the WebSocket broadcast function.

    WebSocket Endpoint (/ws)

        Handles real-time connections from kiosk clients.
        Keeps track of all connected kiosk clients.
        Broadcasts new photos received from /upload to all connected kiosks.

    Connection Manager

        Manages active WebSocket connections.
        Provides methods to connect, disconnect, and broadcast messages.

🖼️ Data Flow:

Mobile React App ---POST /upload---> FastAPI Backend
                                     |
                                     V
                        Broadcast photo via WebSocket (/ws)
                                     |
                                     V
                             Connected Kiosk Clients
